# JavaScript Coding Standards

### General Best Practices
- Use ES6+ syntax wherever possible.
- Modularize code into reusable components.
- Document code with multi-line comments (`/* */`).
- Use JSDoc comments for functions, classes, and methods to provide structured documentation for all public elements.

### Code Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Use camelCase for variables and functions,` PascalCase for classes.
- End all statements with a semicolon (`;`).
- Ensure braces {} are used even for single-line conditionals to avoid ambiguity.
- Maintain proper spacing around operators and between blocks of code to improve readability.

### Testing
- Write unit tests using a framework like Jest.
- Ensure all components/functions are tested independently and as part of the application.
- Ensure to follow the respective library's README file to verify correct testing commands and functionality.

### Front-End Specific
- Add CSS for new components in separate `.css` files.
- Structure JSX tags with code blocks on separate lines for clarity and readability.
- Follow BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) CSS naming conventions to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.
