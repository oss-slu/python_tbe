# JavaScript Coding Standards

### General Best Practices
- Use ES6+ syntax wherever possible.
- Modularize code into reusable components.
- Document code with multi-line comments (`/* */`).

### Code Formatting
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- Use camelCase for variables and functions; PascalCase for classes.
- End all statements with a semicolon (`;`).

### Testing
- Write unit tests using a framework like Jest.
- Ensure all components are tested independently and as part of the application.

### Front-End Specific
- Add CSS for new components in separate `.css` files.
- Structure JSX tags with code blocks on separate lines.
