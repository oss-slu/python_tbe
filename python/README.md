## read_TBE

This project provides a Python script to load and parse TBE (Tabular Data, Attachments, and Comments) files into Python-native data structures. The script extracts metadata, tabular data, attachments, and comments from the file.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- No external dependencies required.

### Files

- load_tbe_file.py: Contains the load_tbe_file function, which reads a TBE file and parses it into Python dictionaries.
- run_tbe_parser.py: The main script that calls load_tbe_file and prints the parsed data to the console.
- example.tbe: An example TBE file containing sample data to be parsed.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Update the file path (if needed)
3. Run the script - Navigate to the src folder and run <code>python run_tbe_parser.py</code>
