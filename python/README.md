## output_csv

The functionality enables us to export TBL data sections into a CSV format, enabling compatibility with other software for tabular data analysis. It enables us to store the extracted TBL data in a structured format suitable for CSV output, ensuring that the correct mapping of attributes occurs. It implements logging (e.g., info or warning) to document issues like empty or malformed sections without interrupting the export process.

Steps to run the code:
1. In the terminal, change the current location to the directory in which the output_csv.py file exists: cd tbe\python\src\functions
2. Run the code using Python: python output_csv.py
3. If there are any issues like empty or malformed sections, the warnings are logged in the terminal.
4. If there are no errors, then you can see a directory named output_csv in the same directory where the output_csv.py file is present.
5. The CSV files are stored in the output_csv directory.
