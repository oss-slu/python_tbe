## isolate_header

This module parses the TBE file and isolates the header information, including global metadata (BGN and EOT attributes) and TBL sections.

### Features:
- **BGN Attributes**: Extracts metadata from the "BGN" section, storing key-value pairs.
- **TBL Sections**: Extracts attributes from each "TBL" section, associating them with the corresponding section name.
- **EOT Attributes**: Extracts metadata from the "EOT" section, similar to BGN.
- **Error Handling**: Handles empty lines, malformed entries, and unknown line types gracefully.
- **Utilities**: Includes helper functions for stripping quotes, splitting CSV lines, and trimming newline characters.

### Functions:
- `parse_TBE_header(const char* filename)`: Parses a TBE file and returns a structured `TBEHeader` object.
- `free_tbe_header(TBEHeader* header)`: Frees memory allocated for a `TBEHeader` object.
- `print_tbe_header(const TBEHeader* header)`: Outputs the parsed header structure for debugging purposes.

### Test:
In the root directory i.e. **tbe**
Run the command - `` gcc -o main c/src/functions/isolate_header.c ``
and run - ``./main``

TBE Batch Processor

This project provides functionality for processing TBE files in batch mode using a combination of C and Python. It parses TBE files from a specified directory, aggregates metadata, generates summaries, and outputs the results in both text and JSON formats.

Features

    Batch Processing: Processes all TBE files in a specified directory.
    Metadata Aggregation: Aggregates metadata such as the total number of files, processed files, skipped files, and record counts.
    JSON Summary: Outputs a metadata summary in a metadata_summary.json file.
    Integration with Python: Uses Python to call the C-based processor for ease of testing and integration.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

    C Compiler: Ensure you have a C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang) installed on your system.
    Python: Python 3.6 or later.
    JSON-C Library: Install the JSON-C library for JSON support in C.

Python Integration

Ensure you have the necessary Python environment and dependencies. For this project, no external Python dependencies are required.

Usage
Process TBE Files

Run the c_tbe_integration.py script using the generated shared library and the sample data:
python3 python/src/functions/c_tbe_integration.py c/src/functions/tbe_batch_processor.c c/src/main.c sample_data


Output

    Console Output: Logs for processed files, skipped files, and a summary of results.
    JSON Output: A metadata_summary.json file containing the aggregated metadata.


1. python_tbe/c_processing/tbe_batch_processor.c

C implementation for batch processing TBE files.
2. python_tbe/c_processing/tbe_batch_processor.h

Header file for the C implementation, defining metadata structures and function declarations.
3. python_tbe/python_conv/c_tbe_integration.py

Python script to integrate with the C shared library and provide a user-friendly interface for processing.
4. sample_data/

Directory containing sample TBE files for testing.
5. .gitignore

Ensures generated files (e.g., tbe_batch_processor.so) are excluded from version control.
6. metadata_summary.json

JSON file generated as output, containing aggregated metadata from processed TBE files.

### Installing MinGW and Running the Program

#### Step 1: Install MinGW

1. Download the MinGW installer from the [MinGW website](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/).
2. Run the installer and select the "Basic Setup" option.
3. Mark the following packages for installation:
   - `mingw32-gcc-g++`
   - `mingw32-gcc-objc`
4. Apply the changes to install the selected packages.
5. Add the MinGW `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\MinGW\bin`) to your systemâ€™s PATH environment variable:
   - Open the Start menu, search for "Environment Variables," and select **Edit the system environment variables**.
   - Click **Environment Variables** and edit the `Path` variable under **System Variables**.
   - Add the full path to MinGW's `bin` directory.

#### Step 2: Compile the Program

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `read_TBE.c`:
   ```bash
   cd c/src/functions
   gcc read_TBE.c -o read_TBE
   ./read_TBE.exe
   ```
